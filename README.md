# minecraft-map-generator
Minecraft world generated from real world data

## Introduction
The project's aim is to visualize the world in the voxel style of Minecraft using data from wcs.

As of now it can only generate relatively small terrain without any features like trees or water, but I hope to make some kind of simple detection for trees from aerial photographs available online.

## Example
From result.asc I generated 1:2 scale schematic from terrain of Szaflary,Poland (I don't live there)
<img src="/img/screenshot1.png" width="60%" height="60%">

I didn't expect to find such a nice terrain here
### Comparison
Old castle on rock from Szaflary

Close to same perspective

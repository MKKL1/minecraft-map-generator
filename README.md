# minecraft-map-generator
Minecraft world generated from real world data

## Introduction
Project's aim is to visualize world in voxel style of minecraft using data from wcs.

As of now it can only generate relativly small terrain without any features like trees or water, but I hope to make some kind of simple detection for trees from aerial photographs available online.
